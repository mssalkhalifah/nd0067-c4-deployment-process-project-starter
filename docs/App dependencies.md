# Overview
This sections focuses on the dependencies of our full-stack web application.

## Front-end
The UI framework is Ionic and it is build on top of Angular. And CoreJS provides tools for creating object-oriented and event driven JavaScript code. And RxJS is used for reactive programming by utilizing observable that makes it easier to compose asynchronous or callback based code. And lastly, Zone.js gives us a way of creating a new context and getting the code executed within that context/zone.
